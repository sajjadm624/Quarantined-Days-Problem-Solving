# Quarantined Days
I have tried to solve some of the problems form online in this repository in the days of Quarentine.
Its a mix up of problems which i found from-
* [Martyr2â€™s Mega Project List](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/)
* [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)

## List of problems
### Numbers
#### Problem No. 1
**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/getting%20the%20value%20of%20pi%20to%20nth%20digit.py)

#### Problem No. 2
**Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/getting%20the%20value%20of%20e%20to%20nth%20digit.py)

#### Problem No. 3
**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/fibonacci%20sequence.py)

#### Problem No. 4
**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Prime%20Factorization.py)

#### Problem No. 5
**Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Next%20Prime%20Number.py)

#### Problem No. 6
**Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor** - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Find%20Cost%20of%20Tile.py)

#### Problem No. 7
**Distance Between Two Cities** - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Distance%20Between%20Two%20Cities.py)

#### Problem No.8
**Credit Card Validator** - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).
** [Soluion](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Credit%20Card%20Validator.py)

#### Problem No. 9
**Complex Number Algebra** - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Complex%20Number%20Algebra.py)

#### Problem No. 10
**Happy Numbers** - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Happy%20Numbers.py)

#### Problem No. 11
**Number Names** - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less). Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Number%20Names.py)

#### Problem No. 12
**Coin Flip Simulation** - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.
** [Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Coin%20Flip%20Simulation.py)

### Classic Algorithms
**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
** [Here](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Collatz%20Conjecture.py)

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort, Bubble sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.
* ** [Merge Sort](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Merge%20Sort.py)
* ** [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Bubble%20Sort.py)
* ** [Quick Sort](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Quick%20Sort.py)
* ** [Heap Sort](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Heap%20Sort.py)
