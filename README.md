# Quarantined Days
I have tried to solve some of the problems form online in this repository in the days of Quarentine.
Its a mix up of problems which i found from-
* [Martyr2â€™s Mega Project List](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/)
* [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)

## List of problems
### Numbers
#### Problem No. 1
**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/getting%20the%20value%20of%20pi%20to%20nth%20digit.py)

#### Problem No. 2
**Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/getting%20the%20value%20of%20e%20to%20nth%20digit.py)

#### Problem No. 3
**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/fibonacci%20sequence.py)

#### Problem No. 4
**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Prime%20Factorization.py)

#### Problem No. 5
**Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Next%20Prime%20Number.py)

#### Problem No. 6
**Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor** - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Find%20Cost%20of%20Tile.py)

#### Problem No. 7
**Distance Between Two Cities** - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.
[Solution](https://github.com/sajjadm624/Quarantined-Days-Problem-Solving/blob/master/Number/Distance%20Between%20Two%20Cities.py)
